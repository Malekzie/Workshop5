Contribution Breakdown:
-Order History Page
-Assisted with Packages Page
-DBO for order history and packages
-Testing and bug reporting registration and package purchases
-Meeting coordination
-Writing privacy page

The order page and it's database operations were programed and refactored by myself.
I helped Benjamin with the packages page and with some of the database operations for registration.
I caught and flagged a few bugs including:
	-Provinces not loading on post request if registration failed validation.
	-Purchasing packages through the cards instead of the carousel always redirecting to package 1.
I also helped to organize meetings and work for the last sprint of the project.
Lastly I wrote the privacy page blurb.

I've added comments on some of the code I've worked on with some learnings, or some potential spots
to learn from, where I used a shoddier method and should work on improving in a future project.
